##Eclipse Backup Plugin
@Under Construction
Backup task in package explorer. The selection gets zipped and transfered to another location. These will be supported:

 * A specified directory
 
 * USB
 
 * Dropbox

 * Google Drive

 * EMail?
 
Although this is primarily an attempt to learn more about Eclipse plug-in development, I sometimes manually backup some project or classfiles on Dropbox to use on another computer. I hardly ever use the export wizard.

###Requirements

 * Eclipse 3.x (Not tested on 4.x)
 
 * Eclipse Plug-in Development Environment
